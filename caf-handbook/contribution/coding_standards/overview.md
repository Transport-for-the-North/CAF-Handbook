# CAF Coding Standards

Code should be read far more than it is written.
Consistency is key to readability.
These are the key principles which guide these standards.
If software can be designed and written in a consistent manner, the readability and maintainability will be improved across Common Analytical Framework.
These standards lay out best practice for how to design software and write code for the Common Analytical Framework; it is part of a suite of Contribution Guidelines.
Where feasible, all software and code should conform to the standards laid out in the following sections.

The standards have been designed around a core set of principles:
- Code and software is read for more than it is written, and consistency is the key to readability.
- It should be easy to switch projects without learning new processes.
- Use automated tools where possible to ensure consistency and ease the burden on TfN staff.
- Every run of a tool and model should be documented, and be easily reproducible.
